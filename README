Final Project Jaipur

... add to this file as we continue ...

We didn't know how to test when our program relied so heavily on stream input. Therefore we tried to get around this by temporarily making
all class members and functions public, so that we could access it from the main executable.

The main executable is JaipurTest. 
Check our code by running:
$ make JaipurTest
$ ./JaipurTest

This file has a lot of our functions getting tested, but most complex functionality (even though it works) can't be done this way. Try it yourself!


EJ: need to error catch if player inputs wrong value for move, i fixed the makefile and why are a bunch of the assertions in Jaipur test failing?
